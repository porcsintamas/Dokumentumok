# Grade 11 End-Term Oral Exam Topics (2025 May 20-30)

## 1. Education, classroom design, brick and mortar vs online education, role of schools/teachers in the 21st century (unit 2 +GC)

In the 21st century, education has transformed significantly, especially with the rise of online education compared to traditional brick-and-mortar schools. First of all, brick-and-mortar schools provide structured environments that encourage social interaction and discipline. In contrast, online education offers flexibility and accessibility, allowing students to learn at their own pace, no matter where they are.
Moreover, the role of schools today is expanding beyond teaching academic subjects. Apart from this, schools now focus on developing critical thinking and creativity, preparing students for a rapidly evolving world. In addition, teachers' roles have shifted dramatically in the last decade. Not only are they expected to convey information, but they are also facilitators of learning, guiding students through technology-enhanced education. As a result, the integration of AI allows personalized learning, making education more adaptable to individual needs.
Another point worth mentioning is the factors that enhance learning and motivation, such as a positive learning environment and innovative teaching methods. Finally, homeschooling has emerged as a popular alternative, offering flexibility but requiring careful planning to balance academics and socialization.
In conclusion, the 21st century is reshaping education through new methods and technologies. All in all, both traditional and modern approaches will likely continue to evolve, offering diverse ways to foster learning. From my point of view, a balanced approach may provide the best opportunities for students in the future.

## 2. Money makes the world go round (unit 3+GC)

The phrase “money makes the world go round” captures the essential role of cash in society, influencing spending habits and fostering mindfulness in purchases. Cash promotes privacy, independence from banks, and resistance to crises, but its tangible nature also shapes societal values. It warns of the risks of losing personal freedom in a digital currency future, where centralized controls could dictate individual spending, limiting autonomy and imagination.
While cash ensures security and resilience, it also highlights the broader impact of money on human lives. Society’s obsession with wealth often overshadows genuine happiness, as people prioritize financial security over dreams and relationships. Although money facilitates life, it should not become an addiction driving relentless accumulation at the cost of emotional well-being.
However, cash carries disadvantages like hygiene concerns, risk of loss, and inconvenience for large transactions or international exchanges. The rise of digital payment systems offers convenience but risks eroding privacy and personal control.
Ultimately, money, whether in cash or digital form, fuels society but should not dominate its purpose. A balanced world prioritizes human connections, passion, and happiness over financial gain, ensuring that daily life remains meaningful beyond mere transactions.


## 3. Different types of holidays,tourism as an industry, favourite destination (unit 4+GC)

Choosing the right holiday type is crucial to creating a memorable experience. For thrill-seekers, options like party holidays or adventure getaways deliver excitement and energy. Winter lovers can enjoy skiing or snowboarding trips, combining sport and stunning mountain views.
If relaxation is your goal, a beach holiday or a cruise vacation offers peaceful escapes. Romantic holidays are perfect for couples, while family holidays offer fun and bonding for all ages.
Culture enthusiasts may prefer city breaks, focused on sightseeing, dining, and urban exploration. For long-term travellers, backpacking trips offer an immersive experience in nature and diverse cultures. Music fans can plan festival holidays, enjoying unique events and vibrant atmospheres.
By aligning your interests, budget, and travel timing with your destination’s features, you can ensure an ideal trip. Whether seeking adventure, relaxation, or cultural enrichment, understanding what you want from a holiday is the first step to making your travel dreams a reality.


## 4. Different services ( Picture based presentation, p63)

### Face, Body or Foot Massage  
1. A face, body or foot massage is a therapeutic treatment that helps relieve tension and anxiety while soothing aches and muscle pains.  
2. This relaxing experience also promotes health and well-being and makes you feel re-energised.  
3. In my opinion, we should definitely consider this service-it would be one of my top two choices.

### Salt-Water Swimming Pool  
1. A salt-water swimming pool provides a low-impact workout that strengthens muscles and helps control weight.  
2. The water’s natural minerals are good for the skin, help eliminate body toxins, and reduce stress.  
3. Although it’s certainly a way to blend exercise and relaxation, I don’t believe it’s as beneficial for us as a massage or hot springs soak.

### Nutrition Counselling  
1. Nutrition counselling offers personalised guidance to establish a balanced diet and healthy, lifelong eating habits.  
2. It can help control weight, reduce stress by ensuring you feel nourished and full of energy, and promote overall well-being.  
3. While very beneficial, I feel that a massage and a hot springs soak would be more directly therapeutic for us right now.

### Personal Training  
1. Personal training guides you to work out correctly, strengthens muscles, and helps establish a lifetime habit of exercise.  
2. With a trainer’s expertise you can target specific muscle pains, improve form, and reduce tension.  
3. I don’t believe we need this service immediately, as our current fitness routine already meets these goals.

### Hot Springs  
1. Hot springs are naturally therapeutic, containing minerals that relieve muscle pains, improve circulation, and eliminate toxins.  
2. Soaking in hot water is deeply relaxing, reduces tension and anxiety, and promotes health and well-being.  
3. In my opinion, we should definitely consider hot springs-it would be my second choice after a good massage.

## 5. Colours and mood, blue zones (unit 6+ GC)

### Colours and mood

Colors have a profound influence on our choices and feelings, often on a subconscious level. Warm colors like red and orange stimulate energy, while cool colors like blue and green promote calmness and relaxation. Cultural backgrounds significantly shape how individuals perceive colors, with meanings varying across societies. For instance, red can symbolize both love and danger, depending on the context. Businesses leverage color psychology to affect consumer behavior, such as using red for urgency or green for eco-friendliness. Colors also impact confidence, with black and red being favored in fashion and social interactions for their elegance and boldness. Additionally, colors influence appetite, as red plates can suppress hunger, while yellow can increase it. Preferences for certain colors, such as blue for happiness, are widespread, though some, like brown and orange, are generally disliked. Interestingly, gender often plays a role in how colors are perceived, with purple dividing opinions. Overall, understanding color psychology can help improve mood, decisions, and daily interactions.

### Blue Zones

The concept of “Blue Zones” invites us to reevaluate how we approach longevity and well-being. These five global regions, where people regularly live vibrant lives into their 90s and beyond, share common traits that extend far beyond genetics. Their lifestyles embody holistic health practices that integrate physical activity, strong social bonds, purposeful living, and balanced nutrition. Importantly, these practices are not rooted in extreme discipline but in environments and cultures that naturally encourage healthful living.
In contrast, modern societies often rely on quick fixes and individual willpower to combat health challenges. Yet, as the Blue Zones demonstrate, sustainable well-being flourishes when communities prioritize structural changes that support healthier choices. From fostering walkable towns to promoting social networks that combat loneliness, the Blue Zones philosophy underscores the power of collective action.
Ultimately, the Blue Zones teach us that longevity isn't just about living longer but about living better—thriving in connection, purpose, and vitality. Communities worldwide can benefit by incorporating these lessons, creating environments where health and happiness become the norm.

## 6. Mindful eating, nutrients (unit 7+GC)

The video "Nutrition PPT Video" explains the fundamentals of nutrition, focusing on six essential nutrient groups: **carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water**. Carbohydrates are the primary energy source, with complex varieties like whole grains providing sustained fuel, while simple carbs (e.g., sugars) offer quick but short-lived energy. Fats, though often misunderstood, are vital for energy storage and organ protection, with unsaturated plant-based fats being healthier than saturated animal fats.  

Proteins, composed of amino acids, are critical for tissue repair and growth, with lean sources like poultry and beans recommended over fattier meats. Vitamins and minerals from fruits and vegetables support bodily functions, such as vitamin A for vision and iron for oxygen transport. **Water** is emphasized as the most crucial nutrient, aiding digestion, joint lubrication, and temperature regulation.  

The video introduces the modern "plate model," replacing the traditional food pyramid. It recommends:  
- **Half the plate** for fruits/vegetables (rich in fiber and antioxidants).  
- **Quarter for whole grains** (complex carbs).  
- **Quarter for lean proteins**.  
- **Low-fat dairy** as a side.  

Practical tips include choosing water over sugary drinks, limiting processed foods high in sodium, and balancing calorie intake with physical activity. The analogy of fueling a car with premium products underscores the importance of quality nutrition for optimal body function.  

## 7. Advantages and disadvantages of advertising, good and bad commercials, how they influence you in your choice (Picture based presentation, p87 +GC)

### 1st version

Advertising and retail strategies play a significant role in influencing consumer behavior, often blending creativity with manipulation. Below is an exploration of good and bad advertising examples, as well as common tricks retailers use to manipulate customers.

## **Good Advertising: Nike's "Just Do It" Campaign**
Nike's "Just Do It" campaign, launched in 1988, is a hallmark of effective advertising. The campaign targeted a broad audience, from professional athletes to everyday individuals, encouraging them to push their limits. Featuring inspiring stories, such as an 80-year-old marathoner running 17 miles daily, the campaign created an emotional connection with consumers. By aligning its message with motivation and healthy living, Nike not only boosted sales but also established a lasting brand identity.

## **Bad Advertising: Fake Mobile Game Ads**
In contrast, fake mobile game ads represent poor advertising practices. These ads often showcase exaggerated gameplay mechanics, such as dramatic pin-pulling puzzles or high-stakes scenarios, which are not part of the actual game. For example, games like *Homescapes* or *Hero Wars* use misleading visuals and narratives to entice downloads. Once installed, users find a completely different experience, leading to disappointment and mistrust. This bait-and-switch tactic may generate initial interest but damages long-term credibility.

## **Tricks Retailers Use to Manipulate Customers**
Retailers employ various psychological tactics to influence purchasing decisions:

- **Pricing Tricks**: Prices ending in ".99" (e.g., $4.99) create the illusion of being cheaper than rounded numbers like $5.00.
- **Scarcity and Urgency**: Phrases like "limited time only" or displaying low stock levels (e.g., "only 3 left!") trigger fear of missing out (FOMO), prompting impulsive purchases.
- **Store Layouts**: Essential items are placed at the back of stores to encourage impulse buying along the way. Additionally, checkout lines are stocked with small, tempting items for last-minute purchases.
- **Decoy Pricing**: Retailers present three price options—low, medium, and high—to nudge customers toward the middle option by making it seem like the best value.
- **Sensory Manipulation**: Stores use ambient music, lighting, and scents (e.g., fresh bread) to create a pleasant environment that encourages spending.

By being aware of these tactics and scrutinizing advertisements critically, consumers can make more informed decisions while avoiding manipulation.

    - With numerous brands competing for attention, it becomes harder for individual campaigns to stand out and capture consumer interest.

#### Conclusion

Advertising is essential for business success but requires careful planning to maximize benefits while addressing its drawbacks. By leveraging targeted strategies and ethical practices, companies can enhance their brand presence while minimizing costs and negative impacts.

## 8. Mind boosting techniques, how to enhance learning (unit 9+GC)

Mind-boosting techniques can turn ordinary study into powerful learning. Although forgetting is natural, most memory lapses happen when information isn’t properly encoded. Two key strategies help overcome this hurdle: mental imagery and context building. Mental imagery means creating clear, vivid pictures of new facts or ideas, which engages multiple brain regions. Context building involves weaving unrelated items into a meaningful story, forming strong associations. Used together, these methods boost recall far more than when applied separately. Brain scans show increased activity after only a few practice sessions, and many people notice real-life benefits—remembering schedules, tasks, or conversations more easily. While these techniques work for anyone, lasting improvement depends on regular, focused practice. In short, memory isn’t fixed; with effort and the right strategies, anyone can enhance their ability to learn and remember.

## 9. Zoos,animals in captivity pros and cons (emelt érettségi, GC)

# The Impact of Wild Animal Captivity

Wild animals in captivity endure significant mistreatment that affects their physical and psychological well-being. According to multiple sources, captivity itself is inherently harmful, forcing animals to live in spaces thousands or even millions of times smaller than their natural ranges. This confinement causes severe stress and frustration as animals cannot express natural behaviors.
Research shows captivity physically alters animals' brains, including thinning of the cerebral cortex, reduced blood flow, and disrupted neurotransmitter balances. These changes lead to stereotypic behaviors like pacing, self-mutilation, and repetitive movements—symptoms of psychological distress collectively known as zoochosis.
While zoos claim conservation purposes, they primarily breed animals to stock exhibits rather than for release. Most captive-born animals remain in captivity their entire lives. Reintroduction to the wild is extremely difficult, especially for complex mammals like primates and cetaceans that require extensive maternal teaching.
Species particularly affected include elephants (who die faster than they're born in captivity), giraffes (who develop stereotypies in small enclosures), and polar bears (whose captivity ironically contributes to climate change—their primary threat in the wild).
Despite some improvements in captive conditions, the entertainment and profit motives of zoos often override animal welfare considerations, making captivity a distraction from true conservation efforts.

## 10. Disasters, environment protection: deforestation, global warming, renewable energy, fossil fuels etc (emelt érettségi + GC)

Disasters linked to environmental degradation—such as floods, droughts and storms—are intensified by deforestation and global warming. When forests are cleared, carbon storage diminishes and soil stability weakens, leading to landslides and reduced rainfall regulation. Rising greenhouse-gas concentrations from burning fossil fuels trap heat in the atmosphere, melting polar ice and fueling extreme weather events. To mitigate these threats, societies must transition towards renewable energy sources—solar, wind and hydroelectric power—which emit far fewer pollutants than coal, oil or natural gas. Reforestation and sustainable land management help restore ecosystems, improve biodiversity and enhance carbon sequestration. Ultimately, combining policy measures, technological innovation and individual responsibility is essential: by reducing fossil-fuel consumption, investing in clean energy and protecting forests, humanity can curb global warming and lessen the severity of future natural disasters.


## 11. Positive and negative consequences of staying in your home country or moving abroad (picture based presentation emelt érettségi p61)

Staying in your home country offers familiar culture, family support and a known job market, easing everyday life and emotional well-being. Local language fluency and established networks simplify career steps and personal relationships. However, limited professional opportunities, lower wages or political uncertainty—especially if the current government remains in power—may constrain growth.
Moving abroad brings exposure to new cultures, languages and work practices, often leading to higher salaries and broader perspectives. It fosters independence, adaptability and global networks. Yet it also entails homesickness, cultural barriers and the challenge of rebuilding social circles. Administrative hurdles—visas, work permits and foreign regulations—can add stress.
Ultimately, choosing between staying and moving means balancing comfort and support against adventure and growth, while weighing how political or economic shifts might shape your future.


## 12. Global issues: unemployment, homelessness (GC)

Homelessness and unemployment are deeply interconnected issues: job loss can strip individuals of income needed for stable housing, while lacking an address or fixed residence often hinders one’s ability to secure work. Globally, factors like economic downturns, mental-health struggles and systemic inequalities fuel both joblessness and housing insecurity, trapping people in cycles of poverty and social exclusion.
In Hungary, these challenges manifest most acutely in rural regions and peripheral urban districts. Long-term unemployment—driven by skill mismatches and automation—pushes some into precarious living situations, while inadequate affordable-housing stock and a recent law penalizing public sleeping further marginalize those at risk. Although government work-programs and NGO shelters offer temporary relief, sustainable solutions demand coordinated investment in vocational training, affordable housing development and comprehensive social supports to break the link between job loss and homelessness.
